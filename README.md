Hey welcome to my   **GFG-160-days-challenge** where I'm posting my solution to the problems in Java and JS. Some times you are luck enough to get more than one solution with the time taken for all the test cases to run.

1. [Second Largest](https://github.com/lakshmir1098/GFG-160-days-challenge/blob/master/01%20Second%20Largest.md)
2. [Move all 0's to the end of the array](https://github.com/lakshmir1098/GFG-160-days-challenge/blob/master/02%20Move%20all%200s%20to%20end.md)
3. [Reverse an array](https://github.com/lakshmir1098/GFG-160-days-challenge/blob/master/03%20Reverse%20an%20array.md)
4. [Rotate an array](https://github.com/lakshmir1098/GFG-160-days-challenge/blob/master/04%20rotate%20array.md)
5. [Next permutation](https://github.com/lakshmir1098/GFG-160-days-challenge/blob/master/05%20Next%20permutation.mds)
6. [Majority Element II]()
